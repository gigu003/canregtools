Canregtools is an R package designed to streamline data analysis, visualization, and reporting in Population-Based Cancer Registration (PBCR). 

It includes five sets of R functions that cover data reading, processing, statistical calculations, visualization, and reporting. The data processing functions carried out tasks such as categorizing age into different groups, classifying ICD-10 (or ICD-O-3) codes into categories using various methods, and tidying variables into a clean format. The statistical calculating functions calculate statistics such as age-standardized rates (ASR), truncated rates, cumulative rates, cumulative risk, lifetime risk, life tables, and other quality indicators. Additionally, it can generate a summary sheet containing some of these statistics.
