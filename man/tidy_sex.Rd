\description{
Standardizes gender-related values into consistent numeric codes or factors.
This function maps various gender-related character strings (e.g., "male",
"female", "man", "woman", "1", "2", etc.) to standardized numeric values:
\code{1} for male, \code{2} for female, and \code{0} for total. It supports both Chinese
and English labels. Optionally, the result can be returned as a factor with
appropriate labels.
