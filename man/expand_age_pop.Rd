\title{Expand population data from 5-year age groups to single-year ages}
\usage{
expand_age_pop(x, method = "linear")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the population counts for each age
group. The vector should have 19 elements corresponding to the following
age groups: 0, 1–4, 5–9, ..., 85+.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the interpolation method to use.
Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"}: Linear interpolation.
\item \code{"constant"}: Constant interpolation.
\item \code{"periodic"}: Periodic spline interpolation.
\item \code{"natural"}: Natural spline interpolation.
}
The default is \code{"linear"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{x}}{Integer ages from 0 to 92.}
\item{\code{y}}{Estimated population counts for each single-year age.}
}
}
\description{
\code{expand_age_pop} transforms population data aggregated in age groups into
estimates for single-year ages. It utilizes interpolation methods to
distribute the grouped data across individual ages, ensuring consistency
with the original totals.
