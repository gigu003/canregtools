\usage{
classify_areacode(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of six-digit Chinese administrative area codes, either as numeric
or character strings.}
}
\value{
A list with the following named elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{areacode}: Validated area codes. Invalid entries are replaced with \code{NA}.
\item \code{registry}: Registry codes corresponding to each area, using a built-in
or cached dictionary.
\item \code{province}: Province-level codes formed by taking the first two digits and
appending \code{"0000"}.
\item \code{city}: City-level codes formed by taking the first four digits and
appending \code{"00"}.
\item \code{area_type}: Urban-rural classification codes: \code{"910000"} for urban,
\code{"920000"} for rural. This can be updated using \code{\link[=write_registry]{write_registry()}}
function which stored the dictionary in (\code{area_type_dict.rds})
\item \code{region}: Region classification codes derived from province codes,
ending in \code{"0000"}.

\description{
Categorizes six-digit administrative division codes of the People's Republic
of China (as per GB/T 2260-2007) into several structured components,
including province, city, area type (urban/rural), registry code, and
regional classification.
}
\details{
This function standardizes and validates area codes, identifies their
administrative levels, and attaches metadata used in cancer registration
systems. It also supports external dictionaries (from the \code{canregtools}
configuration folder) to provide more accurate classification of area types
and registry mapping. Classify Codes for the administrative divisions of
the People's Republic of China(GB/T 2260-2007) into different categories,
including 'province', city', 'area_type', and 'registry' attributes.
