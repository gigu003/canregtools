\title{Calculate the age standardized rate using the direct method}
\usage{
ageadjust(
  count,
  pop,
  rate = NULL,
  stdpop = NULL,
  method = "gamma",
  conf_level = 0.95,
  mp = 1e+05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{The number of cases of a specific disease or condition.}

\item{pop}{The total population of the same group or region
where the disease cases (count) were observed.}

\item{rate}{Disease rate, which is the number of cases (count) per unit
of population (pop).}

\item{stdpop}{Standardized population for age standardization.}

\item{method}{Method used for calculating the age-standardized rate, options
are 'gamma', 'normal', or 'lognormal', default is 'gamma'.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level for calculating confidence
intervals, value between 0 and 1, default is 0.95.}

\item{mp}{A multiplier used to scale the calculated rates. Default is 100000.}
}
\value{
Age standardized rate and its confidence interval.
}
\description{
This function calculates the \strong{age-standardized rate (ASR)} using
the \strong{direct method} of standardization. It allows for adjustment of crude
disease or mortality rates to a standard population structure, enabling
valid comparisons across populations with different age distributions. The
function also supports computation of confidence intervals
using gamma, normal, or log-normal methods, and returns both crude
rate (CR) and ASR with associated variances and interval estimates.
