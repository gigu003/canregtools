\title{Compute a life table from age-specific mortality rates}
\usage{
lt(mx, sage = 0, sep_zero = TRUE, age_width = 5, sex = "male")
}
\arguments{
\item{mx}{Numeric vector of age-specific mortality rates.}

\item{sage}{Integer. Starting age of the first age group (default is 0).}

\item{sep_zero}{Logical. Indicates whether the age 0 group is separated from
the 1â€“4 age group (default is TRUE).}

\item{age_width}{Integer. Width of each age group in years; typically 1 or 5
(default is 5).}

\item{sex}{Character string specifying the sex: "male", "female", or "total"
(default is "male").}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{age}{Starting age of each age group.}
\item{mx}{Age-specific mortality rate.}
\item{qx}{Probability of dying between age x and x+n.}
\item{lx}{Number of survivors at exact age x, starting from a radix of 1.}
\item{dx}{Number of deaths between ages x and x+n.}
\item{Lx}{Person-years lived between ages x and x+n.}
\item{Tx}{Total person-years remaining after age x.}
\item{ex}{Life expectancy at exact age x.}
}
}
\description{
\code{lt()} constructs a life table based on a vector of age-specific mortality
rates (mx), starting age, age group width, and specified sex. It calculates
standard life table columns including the probability of dying (qx),
number of survivors (lx), number of deaths (dx), person-years lived (Lx),
total person-years remaining (Tx), and life expectancy (ex).
}
\details{
The function uses standard demographic formulas to compute life table values.
The average number of person-years lived in the interval by those dying in
the interval (ax) is estimated using the \code{calc_ax()} function, which
applies formulas based on the specified sex and age group width. The
calculations assume a radix (starting population) of 1.
